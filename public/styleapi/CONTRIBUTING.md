Contribution guidelines
=======================

If you want to contribute to this repository or want to get more details about the project structure, please read the following information:

## Workflow

We operate the "Fork & Pull" model explained at

https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests

You should fork the project into your own repo, create a topic branch there and then make one or more pull requests back to the repository. Your pull requests will then be reviewed, discussed and then either merged or rejected.

## Versioning

We currently do not use any versioning for this repository. That reduces the managing overhead for a hobby project like this and saves time that we can spend on doing productive stuff. For a project like this with a continous development process it would be difficult to determine any milestones.
